        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>While working on <a href="../go-mitizen/page.html">Go-Mitizen</a> I wanted to compare the startup speed of my program to the original Commitizen client. For typical CLI commands that run, perform a task, and then immediately exit the <em>time</em> command can be used to measure how long this process took. However, I was working on a TUI (Terminal User Interface), which waits for user input once it has started. Instead, what I needed was an equivalent to the TTI (time to interactive) metric that is prolific in website benchmarking. TTI is an approximation of how long a user must wait before the website or program is ready to be used. Since I couldn't find an existing implementation of this, I decided to write my own.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>

        <p>Measuring TTI occurs in two distinct steps. First, I run the program once and wait a long duration of time. After waiting, my program assumes that whatever output the program has produced in the terminal is interactive. In the second step, I run the program several times, measuring the time until the program's output matches the expected output we captured before. Finally, the user is shown the durations and their average.</p>
        <p>This method works well for many CLI and TUI applications, but there is a class of programs that it fails for. If a program doesn't produce the same output every time it is run, then we can't just compare outputs to determine when a program is interactive. One example of a program like this is <em>top</em>, whose output changes based on the current processes running on the computer. Fixing this would require a far more advanced (and probably cumbersome) way of identifying when a program is interactive, so this solution was perfect for my case.</p>
