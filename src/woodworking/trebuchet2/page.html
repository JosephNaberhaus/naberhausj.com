    <p>After building my first trebuchet I wanted to build something smaller. A >300lb weight box that can throw bricks is fun, but  it is also makes it hard to use. For this trebuchet I used 110lb of tractor weights. This meant that I could pull the arm back with just my body weight.</p>
    <p>Another big change was adding wheels to the bottom. The wheels help the trajectory of the weight box more closely approximate a straight vertical line which increases efficiency.</p>
