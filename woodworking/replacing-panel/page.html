    <h2>Replacing a Panel</h2>
    <section>
        <img class="image_left" width="200" height="367" src="bad-panel.jpg" alt="The side of the chest of drawers showing the botched panel">
        <p>After applying the first coat of stain on a chest of drawers I noticed some swirls made by my orbital sander on one of the inset panels. I thought the stain was still wet enough to simply sand the marks out and then re-apply stain. Instead, after the second coat the area that I sanded appeared as a light spot.</p>
        <p>Dubiously, I tried to sand the whole panel, but I ended up sanding through the veneer long before I got the panel sanded evenly enough to reapply stain. It started as a penny sized splotch and quickly expanded. Watching the oak slowly fade into mahogany was tragic but interesting at the same time.</p>

    <section>
        <img class="image_left" width="200" height="266" src="depth.jpg" alt="Setting the depth of the Rotozip">
        <p>The panel is set in a tongue and groove frame. Therefore, to get it out I had to cut it out from the inside. To do this I used a Rotozip tool. My Dad happened to have the actual brand name tool, but you can also get attachment for a Dremel to do the same thing. I set the depth of the bit to cut to the panel.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <img class="image_left" width="300" height="394" src="guide-stick.jpg" alt="The guide stick for the Rotozip tool screwed into position">
        <p>Then I screwed a guide stick onto the inside. This was set so that the I could run the Rotozip against it to cut just shy of the full depth of the groove.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <img class="image_left" width="200" height="84" src="test-cut.jpg" alt="A test cut">
        <p>A test cut showed that I was cutting to the right depth in both directions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <img class="image_left" width="200" height="208" src="multitool.jpg" alt="Cutting the parts the Rotozip couldn't reach with an oscillating multitool">
        <p>The Rotozip couldn't reach the bottom section. I rough cut them with an oscillating multitool and then cleaned up the cut with chisels.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <img class="image_left" width="300" height="361" src="panel-removed.jpg" alt="The side of the cabinet with the panel removed">
        <p>Once I had cut three of the edges off I could lift the panel up and slide it out of the bottom groove. I had only used a few brad nails and no glue to hold the panel in place, so it slid out easily.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <img class="image_left" width="300" height="400" src="replaced-panel.jpg" alt="The new panel in place">
        <p>I cut out a new panel and glued it in place. I also cut some strips of oak to replace the material that I cut away. To hold everything in place while the glue dried I shot 5/8" brads through both the oak strips and the panel.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <img class="image_left" width="300" height="388" src="finished.jpg" alt="The new panel with stain on it">
        <p>Then I just stained it to match.</p>
