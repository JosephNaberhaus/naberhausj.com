I thought the stain was still wet enough to simply sand the marks out and then re-apply stain. Instead, after the second coat the area that I sanded appeared as a light spot.<p>Dubiously, I tried to sand the whole panel, but I ended up sanding through the veneer long before I got the panel sanded evenly enough to reapply stain. It started as a penny sized splotch and quickly expanded. Watching the oak slowly fade into mahogany was tragic but interesting at the same time.</section><section><img class=image_left width=200 height=266 src=depth.jpg alt="Setting the depth of the Rotozip"><p>The panel is set in a tongue and groove frame. Therefore, to get it out I had to cut it out from the inside. To do this I used a Rotozip tool. My Dad happened to have the actual brand name tool, but you can also get attachment for a Dremel to do the same thing. I set the depth of the bit to cut to the panel.</section><section><img class=image_left width=300 height=394 src=guide-stick.jpg alt="The guide stick for the Rotozip tool screwed into position"><p>Then I screwed a guide stick onto the inside. This was set so that the I could run the Rotozip against it to cut just shy of the full depth of the groove.</section><section><img class=image_left width=200 height=84 src=test-cut.jpg alt="A test cut"><p>A test cut showed that I was cutting to the right depth in both directions.</section><section><img class=image_left width=200 height=208 src=multitool.jpg alt="Cutting the parts the Rotozip couldn't reach with an oscillating multitool"><p>The Rotozip couldn't reach the bottom section. I rough cut them with an oscillating multitool and then cleaned up the cut with chisels.</section><section><img class=image_left width=300 height=361 src=panel-removed.jpg alt="The side of the cabinet with the panel removed"><p>Once I had cut three of the edges off I could lift the panel up and slide it out of the bottom groove. I had only used a few brad nails and no glue to hold the panel in place, so it slid out easily.</section><section><img class=image_left width=300 height=400 src=replaced-panel.jpg alt="The new panel in place"><p>I cut out a new panel and glued it in place. I also cut some strips of oak to replace the material that I cut away. To hold everything in place while the glue dried I shot 5/8" brads through both the oak strips and the panel.</section><section><img class=image_left width=300 height=388 src=finished.jpg alt="The new panel with stain on it"><p>Then I just stained it to match.</section></article><div class=footer><div class=social-links><a class=social_link href=mailto:contact@naberhausj.com><img class=social_link_icon src=/components/footer/social-link/email.svg alt=E-mail><div class=social_link_name>E-mail</div></a><a class=social_link href=http://github.com/josephNaberhaus><img class=social_link_icon src=/components/footer/social-link/github.svg alt=Github><div class=social_link_name>Github</div></a><a class=social_link href=https://www.youtube.com/c/JosephNaberhaus><img class=social_link_icon src=/components/footer/social-link/youtube.svg alt=YouTube><div class=social_link_name>YouTube</div></a><a class=social_link href=/components/footer/social-link/joseph-naberhaus-public.gpg><img class=social_link_icon src=/components/footer/social-link/key.svg alt="Public Key"><div class=social_link_name>Public Key</div></a><a class=social_link href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/naberhausj><img class=social_link_icon src=/components/footer/social-link/linkedin.svg alt=LinkedIn><div class=social_link_name>LinkedIn</div></a></div><div class=copyright>&copy; Joseph Naberhaus 2020</div></div></body></html>
